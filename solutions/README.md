This is the folder with the solutions to this lab.

I always provide the solutions so that if you are stuck, you can always learn from this solution.  Your work during Lab Sessions will not be assessed. Instead, your actual effort in the DRAW week mini-project and final project will carry respective 15% and 25% of the module.
